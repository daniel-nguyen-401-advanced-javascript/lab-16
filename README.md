# Event Driven Applications
    
- Create an event driven application that “distributes” logging commands to separate modules. Our application will be called CAPS, the Code Academy Parcel Service. CAPS will simulate a delivery service where sellers will ship products and be notified when customer receives those products.

## Challenge
    
Create three events, `pickup`, `in-transit`, and `delivered`.

Your application should automatically generate random orders every 5 seconds. These random orders should have a store, id, customer, and address as the order data.
    
## Testing
    
- `npm test`
